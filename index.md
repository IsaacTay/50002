## Hello World!
<strong>*Full stack development starts here.*</strong>

**50.002** introduces the **architecture** of digital systems, emphasising **structural** principles common to a wide range of technologies. In specific, the course develops:
* A hierarchical set of **building blocks** that make up a digital system  (logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite state machines, processors, and complete systems)
* Understanding of the operation of a moderately complex digital system; a simple RISC-based computer we called the $$\beta$$ using the building blocks above, and ability to specify, implement and **debug** its components.
* Exploration of both **hardware** and **software** mechanisms through a series of design examples (labs and 1D/2DC projects)

By the end of this course, you're expected to:
* Be familiar with flaws and limitations in simple systems using the **static discipline**, **clocked** registers and async inputs.
* Implement a simple RISC-based CPU architecture
* Apply architectural support and tackle instruction set design issues for contemporary software structures.
* Analyse of potential concurrency, precedence constraints, and performance measures.

All lesson materials: **lecture notes**, **problem sets**, and **FPGA tutorials** can be found in this site. Please refer to the **50.002 course handout** (link in edimension) to obtain the links to our lab handouts. 

We have also recorded [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_) and [post-lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLklpDKpv-EBhCVUAZDDRWEGZzR_It-FSo) for each topic. The links to the individual videos can be found in the respective lecture notes. 

*Have fun!*
