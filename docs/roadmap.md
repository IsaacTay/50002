## Roadmap 

### The Blind Men and an Elephant
It is often really difficult to visualise why we learn certain topics in 50.002. Each weekly topic is a **building block** to understand how **digital systems** work (a.k.a your computers). By itself, it is **not obvious** why it is an integral part to learn in your journey as a computer scientist. It's like the parable of a [**blind men and an elephant**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant).

> *The parable of the blind men and an elephant is a story of a group of blind men who have **never** come across an elephant before and who learn and imagine what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a **different** part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim **absolute** truth based on their **limited**, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.*

We ask you to be patient and **bear with us** as you go through this Term. Lots of **frustration**, **confusion**, and even **exasperation** is common but not unmanaged. Talk to your TAs and Instructors for guidance at any moment in time, and **try to avoid snowballing** of work as much as possible. 



## 50.002 Roadmap
Here's a Roadmap for you to help you get through tough times. Each node is **clickable** and will direct you to the relevant lecture notes.

## Job Prospects

Now that you know the bird's eyeview of 50.002, let's briefly go through possible job prospects that you can have should you equip yourselves with the knowledge of **how computers work**.
> Yes, there are more jobs out there than web developers.

### System Security Engineer
If you're planning to take [50.044](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/undergraduate/courses/50044-system-security) in the future and work in system security related field, pay great attention to 50.002. As a system security expert, you're expected to protect the security of users, individual computer systems, including personal computers, smart cards and embedded platforms. You **need** to know how digital systems are made and work down to the hardware level before even beginning to protect it. 

### Hardware and Embedded System Engineer, CPU and Platform Architect 
Every year, major tech companies always release their new, cutting edge technologies, be it new CPU architecture, better and faster motherboard, etc. Terms like **unified memory**, **z-nm transistors**, basic CPU specs like **L-cache, overclocking, TDP rating, clock speed** should sound really familiar to you. Would you like to be the ones who contribute in their development? 

### System on Chip Engineer
System on Chip (SOC) is the integration of functions necessary to implement an electronic system onto a single substrate and contains at least one processor. It is a **popular** field as of today (2023) due to its unprecendented efficiency. have you ever wondered why? 

### Cybersecurity Expert
Any career in cybersecurity requires a deep technical knowledge on how digital systems (that you're protecting) work. Obviously, you can't professionally protect a house without knowing its schematic, materials, weak points, etc. 

### Operating System Engineer 
Building the next-generation Operating System? Surely you need to be familiar with the architecture of the CPU you're building it for. 

### Tech Lead, DevOps Engineer
Any good fullstack software engineer needs to have a pretty good idea about the Operating System, Network, and Security. In order to appreciate the knowledge in these domain, it is fundamental to understand basic principles of how our computers work, all the way down to its ISA. You'll never know when you'll be faced with some very weird bugs that requires systematic debugging, or needing to fix major vulnerability in your system. 

### Contributing to Open Source Project
Thinking to contribute to improve the Linux Kernel? Or writing the next-generation debugger? Contributing by making merge requests to fix open issues in famous backend/frontend framework? How about making an efficient front-end framework by yourself? Maybe you'll also want to create your own game engine, or simply answer questions in StackOverflow. Yep, think big.  

### Other Fields and Application
Other non-directly related fields that require you to work with **hardware and software optimisation**, deep diving into **assembly code** or making a tweak or two to your compiler requires the basic building blocks taught in 50.002. Knowing how digital systems work really equip you with all of the necessary knowledge to **troubleshoot** and **debug** almost anything.
